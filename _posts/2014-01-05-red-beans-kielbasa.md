title: Red Beans with Kielbasa
---

> I cook this in an enameled cast iron dutch oven and serve it over [Coconut Tumeric Rice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-01-06-coconut-tumeric-rice %}).

* 1/2 lb turkey kielbasa, andouille, or other sausage
	* basically, one loop of kielbasa, 3-4 in reserved for breakfast
* 1 small onion , diced
* 2 t vegetable oil
* 1/2 t red pepper flakes or 1 small fresh chile, minced
* 1/2 t dried thyme
* 1/2 t allspice
* 1 healthy pinch of kosher salt
* 2 14.5 (or 1 28 oz) ounce can of diced tomatoes
* 1lb dry red kidney beans, about 2 cups (or 3-4 cans, drained)  
* Some yogurt or sour cream
* Chopped scallions and/or cilantro

Cook the sausage if it is raw. Remove from pan and drain the fat.

While the rice is cooking, in a saucepan on medium heat, saut√© the onions in the vegetable oil for 2 or 3 minutes, then add sausage and cook for an addional 2 -3 minutes.

Add the red pepper flakes, sprinkle lightly with salt, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, for 5 to 8 minutes.

Add the thyme, allspice, tomatoes, and beans, cover, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

I usually rinse out the tomato cans with about 1/2 c water (total) and add it to the pot.

Serve over [Coconut Tumeric Rice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-01-06-coconut-tumeric-rice %}).

Top with yogurt or sour cream and garnish with scallions and/or cilantro.
