title: Coconut Tumeric Rice
---

> I'm still working out some reasonable proportions on this one.

* 2 c white rice
* 1 t turmeric
* 1 t vegetable oil
* 1/4 t salt (you can skip this)
* 1 14 oz can  coconut milk, plus 1 can water

Rinse and drain the rice

In a saucepan on medium heat, saut√© the rice, turmeric, and salt in the vegetable oil for a minute or two, stirring constantly

Add the water and coconut milk, bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat to low

Simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes
